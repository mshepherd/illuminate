WHAT IS THIS THEME
==================
This is intended as a fairly general purpose theme to quicken illuminate's
development of site themes for clients. It's a subtheme of Fusion Core, a
Drupal starter theme. http://drupal.org/project/fusion. It works well with, and
in some cases relies on, a number of Drupal modules. These will be outlined
here. Some day, this may be released as a Drupal installation profile, but
probably not until it has been ported to Drupal 7.

Requirements
------------

* This is a fusion sub-theme and will not work without fusion core.
  - http://drupal.org/project/fusion - 6.x-1.0 or above

* I've implemented rounded corners in the theme. These are defined in the
  template.php file and the functions there are defined in the rounded corners
  module. You'll need to install and enable that module before enabling this
  theme. Mark my words!
  - http://drupal.org/project/rounded_corners - version 6.x-3.0-alpha2 or above

Other stuff
-----------

* I've used the node_gallery module for image galleries on my template site.
  It's getting more and more mature and flexible with each release. The newer
  releases support views much more completely and this theme provides styling
  galleries and images of those recent releases
  - http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery - version 6.x-3.0-alpha2 or above

* We're an organisation who work closely with charities and voluntary sector
  organisations, many of whom have very specific accessibility requirements.
  I've used the page_style and text_size modules to provide style switches to
  change background/foreground colours and text size. This theme provides
  styles and new images for these 2 modules. I found the default images too
  small - our customers made this same comment.
  - http://drupal.org/project/pagestyle - version 6.x-1.9 or above
  - http://drupal.org/project/textsize - version 6.x-1.9 or above

* I prefer a little control over the readmore link and I've used the Read More
  Link module. This theme provides a style override for the gallery list page,
  moving the link so it sits under the body text.

Overrides
---------

This theme overrides some drupal defaults and some module defaults:

* Some template.php code makes some changes to the block search form, it leaves
  the default search form alone.

* Some node_gallery behaviour is changed in a custom module. See
  https://github.com/mshepherd/iutilities. I like to have the gallery
  description (body text) before the images on the gallery page. And I prefer
  to have the title and teaser text together on the gallery list page.
